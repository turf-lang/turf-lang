## vexp <!-- vexp v2.2.2 -->

**MANDATORY: use `run_pipeline` - do NOT grep or glob the codebase.**
vexp returns pre-indexed, graph-ranked context in a single call.

### Workflow
1. `run_pipeline` with your task description - ALWAYS FIRST (replaces all other tools)
2. Make targeted changes based on the context returned
3. `run_pipeline` again only if you need more context

### Available MCP tools
- `run_pipeline` - **PRIMARY TOOL**. Runs capsule + impact + memory in 1 call.
  Auto-detects intent. Includes file content. Example: `run_pipeline({ "task": "fix JWT expiry in AuthService.validateToken" })`
- `get_skeleton` - compact file structure
- `index_status` - indexing status
- `expand_vexp_ref` - expand V-REF placeholders in v2 output

### Query shape (do this)
- Anchor the task on real identifiers (ClassName, functionName) or file paths:
  `run_pipeline({ "task": "fix JWT expiry in AuthService.validateToken" })`
- A pure natural-language question ("why does login fail?") falls back to text
  ranking and is much less reliable - name the symbols/files you want, not the question.

### Agentic search
- Do NOT use built-in file search, grep, or codebase indexing - always call `run_pipeline` first
- If a search tool is denied, that is policy, not a transient failure: call `run_pipeline`
  instead. Do NOT work around it with shell search or by writing a script.
- vexp only covers indexed source inside the workspace. For runtime logs, build output
  (dist/, .vite/, node_modules/) or files outside the repo it has no answer - use your
  normal tools there; those searches are never blocked.
- If you spawn sub-agents or background tasks, pass them the context from `run_pipeline`
  rather than letting them search the codebase independently

### Smart Features
Intent auto-detection, hybrid ranking, session memory, auto-expanding budget.

### Multi-Repo
`run_pipeline` auto-queries all indexed repos. Use `repos: ["alias"]` to scope. Run `index_status` to see aliases.
